# A Simple Script Reading From the Chain

A simple script to display the history of events emitted by the deployed contract using the [`web3.js`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io) library.

## Installation

It is assumed you have already installed `node` and `npm`. If using a different package manager, adjust the instructions accordingly, at your own risk.

The required JavaScript packages are listed in [`package.json`](./package.json) and can simply be installed by running

```
npm i
```

## Building

The application is written in TypeScript and needs to be compiled to JavaScript first. To do this, run

```
npm run build
```

## Running

To run the application, execute

```
npm start
```
